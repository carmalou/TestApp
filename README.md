App to test electron autoUpdate feature

I've been struggling with the autoUpdate feature for some time now. Was hoping to get some help

The app simply opens up a page with a CSS loader. I'd like to create version 1.0.1 of the app where the loader is color blue or sth.
I intend to pull the updates from a simple file sharing service.
